Splicing:
- [PyMOL4Spliceosome](https://github.com/mmagnus/PyMOL4Spliceosome) - structures of spliceosome processed to be easily viewed with PyMOL
- [yeast-spotifier](https://github.com/mmagnus/yeast-spotifier) - a script to process yeast plate image into figures :-)

SCIENCE:
- [pubmex]( https://github.com/mmagnus/pubmex) - get a fancy paper title based on detected or given DOI or PMID

RNA
- [rna-tools](https://github.com/mmagnus/rna-tools) - a toolbox to analyze sequences, structures and simulations of RNA (and more) docs @ http://rna-tools.rtfd.io
- [RNA-Puzzles-Standardized-Submissions](https://github.com/mmagnus/RNA-Puzzles-Standardized-Submissions) - Curated structures submitted to the RNA-Puzzles experiment

For nerds:
- [emacs-env](https://github.com/mmagnus/emacs-env) - I've been using Emacs ‚ù§Ô∏è for over 13 (since 2007) years now. This's my config file :-) it might be useful for someone.
- [emacs-pdb-mode](https://github.com/mmagnus/emacs-pdb-mode) - pdb-mode is an emacs-lisp minor mode for Emacs to perform a number of useful editing functions on Protein DataBank (PDB) formatted files. XEmacs and/or GNU Emacs are available for most computing platforms.
